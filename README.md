This repository includes the models for the ACM270 projects.

The Lorenz96 ML model comes from [Brajard et al. 2020](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750320304725), from the [brajard/GMD-code](https://github.com/brajard/GMD-code) repo. The Darcy ML model is a [Fourier neural operator](https://openreview.net/forum?id=c8P9NQVtmnO) from the neuralop package. The QG ML model is from [Chattopadhyay et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199912300013X), from the [ashesh6810/Hybrid-Ensemble-Kalman-Filter](https://github.com/ashesh6810/Hybrid-Ensemble-Kalman-Filter) GitHub repo.



The easiest way to install the dependencies for each of the models is to use the conda package manager (which you can get through [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)), and to create an environment from the `environment.yml` file in each of the directories (see [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)).
